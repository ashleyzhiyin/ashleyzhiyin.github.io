Grateful to Singapore and CPGFM for Giving Me a New Lease on Life

The past six months in Singapore have marked a fresh start in my life, and I’m deeply grateful for the support from [CPG Facilities Management Pte Ltd (CPG FM)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cpg-facilities-management-pte-ltd/). 

I discovered my career path. Thanks to the leaders and colleagues I’ve met, I’ve received respect and valuable guidance in the workplace. They taught me essential business skills, as well as effective communication and collaboration techniques. I applied my policy analysis and data analytics skills in the industry and also took the initiative to learn foundational finance and accounting knowledge to broaden my expertise.

I also participated in business consulting cases and finance competitions, teaming up with outstanding peers from diverse backgrounds. Through these experiences, I learned how to collaborate effectively and work as part of a team.

Beyond work, I cultivated stable and meaningful hobbies. During this time, I completed 11 ballet classes, 15 street dance sessions, and began learning the basics of golf. These activities have nurtured my inner calm, discipline, and strategic thinking, adding balance and energy to my life.

Looking ahead, I am motivated to keep growing and embrace new challenges and opportunities.
