2025 was a year of pressure, complexity, and real growth for me. Rather than following a linear or comfortable path, I navigated multiple systems simultaneously—academics, immigration constraints, early-career positioning, and cross-border decisions. While this came with anxiety and uncertainty, it also forced me to develop resilience, structure, and professional clarity. By the end of 2025, I am no longer “exploring aimlessly,” but operating with a defined skill set in finance, data, and research, and with a clearer understanding of how global systems function.

Importantly, 2025 taught me that effort alone is not enough—strategy and sequencing matter more than intensity.
