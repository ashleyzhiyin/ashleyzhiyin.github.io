Back to Ewha Womans University [이화여자대학교](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewha_Womans_University), where I once joined a summer exchange program and connected with students and faculty worldwide. ❣️ 

In sociology courses, we explored key issues like hakwon (supplementary education), gender roles, and economic development. For the final paper, I combined data analysis and interviews to study how gender shapes attitudes toward marriage and childbearing in South Korea.

Grateful for the opportunity to deepen my understanding of East Asian societies through both academic and cross-cultural experiences. Looking forward to applying these insights to my future work in policy analysis and social research.
